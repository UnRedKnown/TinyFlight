Also, we need a good tutorial. As in the first time the game is booted up, we ask the user `"It appears you haven't yet played this game, would you like a tutorial?": Y/n` and if they press yes, we have something like flight training. As in there is a "wingman" speaking to you, telling you what things are and what buttons do. 
**Example:**
- So, since this is your first time flying, we will be going over the basic flight training scenario. Let's start with the heads up display, or HUD: right in the middle you will see the artificial horizon. This indicates your pitch and roll. Move your control stick to see how it changes.
-# Show a sprite of the DPAD getting pressed, wait until user pressed all buttons, then wait 5 seconds to let the user play around.
- Nice, now get the aircraft flying level, and we can proceed.
-# Show a sprite of the DPAD getting pressed, in a direction which would get the aircraft to level flight, wait until the planes pitch is ~ 0, and roll is ~ 0, then fix both to 0.
- Now that you know how to turn,  let's also address speed. On the left of the screen, you will see the aircraft's airspeed in knots
-# Blink red around the speed display for 1.5 seconds
- In the bottom right corner,
-# Blink red around the throttle display
- you will see the throttle. That is basically your gas pedal. 
-# Stop blinking red around the throttle display
- On the left and right sides of your cockpit, you will see 2 buttons, one will increase the throttle, the other one will decrease it, try it.
-# Show a sprite of the shoulder buttons getting pressed, wait until user pressed both buttons, then wait 5 seconds to let the user play around
- Alright, now on the right side of the screen, you can see the altitude display.
-# Blink red around the altitude display for 1 second.
- This indicates how many feet you are off the ground.
- On the top of the HUD you will see your heading - a compass.
- In the bottom right, you will see your vertical speed.
-# Blink red VERT text for 1 second
- That indicates how quickly you are going up or down. 
- In the dead center of the screen you can see a flight path vector. This points to where your nose is pointed.
- Below it, you can see the "bird". That'll will show you where your aircraft is going.
- Below the speed indicator, 
-# Blink red M, G, and a text
- you can see Mach, G's, and angle of attack respectively.
-# Stop blinking red M, G, and a text
- I'm gonna assume you know what Mach and G's are if you don't you can look it up after we're finished, so, let's skip to the angle of attack. That is the difference between the angle of your wings, and the oncoming air. A higher AoA will be equal to higher drag, thus - lower airspeed.
- And for the most important one - your radar warning receiver, or RWR. This will show you if you're getting locked by an aircraft, a missile, and will show you any nearby missile launches. Let's simulate a scenario of a hostile sending a Fox 3.
-# Get random data on enemy position, and spawn fake missile.
- The green line, will show you where you're getting locked from. A yellow arc will indicate a missile launch, and a red line will indicate the missiles position, if it pitbulls on you.
-# Wait until missile reaches user, or is outmaneuvered, then say either "Now since the missile hit you, you would explode, but we don't like killing our cadets, so this one is a freebie" or general surprise that the user outmaneuvered the missile
- That's for unseen threats. Now for ones you can see - the straight line indicates a ground enemy emitting radar waves. Things like SAM sites, radars, or grounded craft. The up arrow indicates airborne signatures - blue ones are friendlies, orange ones are hostiles.
- That's all for the HUD, you want a break or should we continue?
-# Show a sprite of A and B buttons, A to continue, B to leave for now. After pressing, play the dialogue for the player - either "I've got nothing else to do, let's continue" or "I'm a bit overwhelmed, let's finish this later". Depending on choice, either return to main menu, or continue tutorial.
- Ok, I see you're determined. Let's go over the remaining buttons in your cockpit. These buttons can change function based on the mode you're in.
-# Blink red around mode display for 1 second
- You can press the button below your control stick to change between these modes.
-# Show sprite of menu button getting pressed, wait until user pressed the button
- Now, switch to the taxi mode
-# Wait until user switches to taxi mode
- In this mode, the buttons on your right, will serve for ground maneuvers, the left button serving to deploy the launch bar, and the right button to serve as the brake. Now switch to flight mode.
-# Wait until user switches modes
- Here you can toggle landing gear with the left button, toggle the arrestor hook with the right one, and you can hold the right one to toggle VTOL mode, if one is available for your aircraft. Now switch to the last one - weapons mode.
-# Wait until user switches modes
- When in this mode, master arm is automatically engaged, so you don't have to worry about your weapons not firing. You will use the left button to shoot the weapon you selected with the right button. The appropriate overlay will be displayed depending on the weapon type you select.  Now, there is another function of the button below your stick. Try holding it.
-# Wait until user holds menu button
- This is your data page. Here you can see your armament, flight data, objectives, navigation,
